## Project: Excel Data Analysis for Bike Company 

**Description:** To highlight my proficiency in Excel, I undertook a data analysis project centered around a bike company's customer database. 
The initial dataset was presented with inconsistencies and repeated data. My objective was to first clean the data, extract relavant information, 
and transform it into actionable visualizations. Key data points were customer demographics such as gender, income, education, commuting distance, 
region, and age. Using various Excel functions and techniques, I curated the dataset into structured tables. The culmination of this effort was the creation 
of insightful charts, shedding light on buyer behavior, areas of improvement, and the company's existing successes.

***Skills Used: Excel, Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Charts, MAX/MIN, SUMIF, IFS, TRIM, COUNT***
